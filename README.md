# Telegram Mini App

This project contains a simple Telegram bot with a web app frontend.

Before running the bot, you must set the `TG_API_TOKEN` environment variable with the bot token:

```bash
export TG_API_TOKEN="<your token>"
```

Then start the bot with `python game.py` or integrate it in your own application.
